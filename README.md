Scalable and Modular Object Oriented HTML (using Jade templates) and styles (using Stylus CSS language). This project is influenced and based heavily on SMACSS and OOCSS.

These styles and templates are designed to be used as a starting point for module/component based web apps. Pull requests are encouraged but so help me god it if it is an automated pull request with a "funny" message to add Travis CI support.

**NOTE:** I am specifically using this project with web apps that are using HTML5 application assembler [Brunch](http://brunch.io) which has a convention to NOT auto-include files that start with an underscore and this is the reason files start with an underscore.
