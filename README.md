=======

Scalable and Modular Object Oriented HTML (using Jade templates) and Styles (using Stylus CSS language). Influenced and based heavily on SMACSS and OOCSS.

These styles and templates are designed to be used as a base/starting point for module/component based web sites/apps. Specifically I am using this with web apps projects that are using [Brunch](http://brunch.io) (which has a convention to not auto include files that start with `_` (underscore) and is the reason any files in this project start with `_`).
